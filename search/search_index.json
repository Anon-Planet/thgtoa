That IP is the IP you are using at the source. This is where you connect to the internet. That IP is usually provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) (xDSL, Mobile, Cable, Fiber, Cafe, Bar, Friend, Neighbor). Most countries have data retention regulations<sup>27</sup> that mandate keeping logs of who is using what IP at a certain time/date for up to several years or indefinitely. Your ISP can tell a third party that you were using a specific IP at a specific date and time, years after the fact. If that IP (the original one) leaks at any point for any reason, it can be used to track down you directly. In many countries, you will not be able to have internet access without providing some form of identification to the provider (address, ID, real name, e-mail ...).</p> <p>Needless to say, that most platforms (such as social networks) will also keep (sometimes indefinitely) the IP addresses you used to sign-up and sign into their services.</p> <p>Here are some online resources you can use to find some information about your current public IP right now:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Find your IP:</p> <ul> <li> <p>https://resolve.rs/</p> </li> <li> <p>https://www.dnsleaktest.com/ (Bonus, check your IP for DNS leaks)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Find your IP location or the location of any IP:</p> <ul> <li>https://resolve.rs/ip/geolocation.html</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Find if an IP is \"suspicious\" (in blacklists) or has downloaded \"things\" on some public resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p>https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx</p> </li> <li> <p>https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search</p> </li> <li> <p>https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com (Take this with a grain of salt, it might not show anything interesting and has limited data sources.

It is a huge \"contact list\" (phone book for older people) that works like asking it a name and it returns the number to call. Except it returns an IP instead.</p> <p>Every time your browser wants to access a certain service such as Google through www.google.com. Your Browser (Chrome or Firefox) will query a DNS service to find the IP addresses of the Google web servers.</p> <p>Here is a video explaining DNS visually if you are already lost: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxwXXytEuI <sup>[Invidious]</sup></p> <p>Usually, the DNS service is provided by your ISP and automatically configured by the network you are connecting to. This DNS service could also be subject to data retention regulations or will just keep logs for other reasons (data collection for advertising purposes for instance). Therefore, this ISP will be capable of telling everything you did online just by looking at those logs which can, in turn, be provided to an adversary. Conveniently this is also the easiest way for many adversaries to apply censoring or parental control by using DNS blocking<sup>32</sup>. The provided DNS servers will give you a different address (than their real one) for some websites (like redirecting thepiratebay.org to some government website). Such blocking is widely applied worldwide for certain sites<sup>33</sup>.</p> <p>Using a private DNS service or your own DNS service would mitigate these issues, but the other problem is that most of those DNS requests are by default still sent in clear text (unencrypted) over the network. Even if you browse PornHub in an incognito Window, using HTTPS and using a private DNS service, chances are exceedingly high that your browser will send a clear text unencrypted DNS request to some DNS servers asking basically \"So what's the IP address of www.pornhub.com?\".</p> <p>Because it is not encrypted, your ISP and/or any other adversary could still intercept (using a Man-in-the-middle attack<sup>97</sup>) your request will know and possibly log what your IP was looking for. The same ISP can also tamper with the DNS responses even if you are using a private DNS. Rendering the use of a private DNS service useless.</p> <p>As a bonus, many devices and apps will use hardcoded DNS servers bypassing any system setting you could set. This is for example the case with most (70%) Smart TVs and a large part (46%) of Game Consoles<sup>34</sup>. For these devices, you will have to force them<sup>35</sup> to stop using their hardcoded DNS service which could make them stop working properly.</p> <p>A solution to this is to use encrypted DNS using DoH (DNS over HTTPS<sup>36</sup>), DoT (DNS over TLS<sup>37</sup>) with a private DNS server (this can be self-hosted locally with a solution like pi-hole<sup>38</sup>, remotely hosted with a solution like nextdns.io or using the solutions provided by your VPN provider or the Tor network). This should prevent your ISP or some go-between from snooping on your requests ... except it might not.</p> <p>Small in-between Disclaimer: This guide does not necessarily endorse or recommend Cloudflare services even if it is mentioned several times in this section for technical understanding.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the TLS protocol used in most HTTPS connections in most Browsers (Chrome/Brave among them) will leak the Domain Name again through SNI<sup>39</sup> handshakes (this can be checked here at Cloudflare: https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/encrypted-sni/ <sup>[Archive.org]</sup> ). As of the writing of this guide, only Firefox-based browsers supports ECH (Encrypted Client Hello<sup>40</sup> previously known as eSNI<sup>41</sup>) on some websites which will encrypt everything end to end (in addition to using a secure private DNS over TLS/HTTPS) and will allow you to hide your DNS requests from a third party<sup>42</sup>. And this option is not enabled by default either so you will have to enable it yourself.</p> <p></p> <p>In addition to limited browser support, only web Services and CDNs<sup>43</sup> behind Cloudflare CDN support ECH/eSNI at this stage<sup>44</sup>. This means that ECH and eSNI are not supported (as of the writing of this guide) by most mainstream platforms such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Amazon (including AWS, Twitch...)</p> </li> <li> <p>Microsoft (including Azure, OneDrive, Outlook, Office 365...)</p> </li> <li> <p>Google (including Gmail, Google Cloud...)</p> </li> <li> <p>Apple (including iCloud, iMessage...)</p> </li> <li> <p>Reddit</p> </li> <li> <p>YouTube</p> </li> <li> <p>Facebook</p> </li> <li> <p>Instagram</p> </li> <li> <p>Twitter</p> </li> <li> <p>GitHub</p> </li> <li> <p>...</p> </li> </ul> <p>Some countries like Russia<sup>45</sup> and China<sup>46</sup> might (unverified despite the articles) block ECH/eSNI handshakes at the network level to allow snooping and prevent bypassing censorship. Meaning you will not be able to establish an HTTPS connection with a service if you do not allow them to see what it was.</p> <p>The issues do not end here. Part of the HTTPS TLS validation is called OCSP<sup>47</sup> and this protocol used by Firefox-based browsers will leak metadata in the form of the serial number of the certificate of the website you are visiting. An adversary can then easily find which website you are visiting by matching the certificate number<sup>48</sup>. This issue can be mitigated by using OCSP stapling<sup>49</sup>. Unfortunately, this is enabled but not enforced by default in Firefox/Tor Browser. But the website you are visiting must also be supporting it and not all do. Chromium-based browsers on the other hand use a different system called CRLSets<sup>50</sup>'<sup>51</sup> which is arguably better.</p> <p>Here is a list of how various browsers behave with OCSP: https://www.ssl.com/blogs/how-do-browsers-handle-revoked-ssl-tls-certificates/ <sup>[Archive.org]</sup></p> <p>Here is an illustration of the issue you could encounter on Firefox-based browsers:</p> <p></p> <p>Finally, even if you use a custom encrypted DNS server (DoH or DoT) with ECH/eSNI support and OCSP stapling, it might still not be enough as traffic analysis studies<sup>52</sup> have shown it is still possible to reliably fingerprint and block unwanted requests. Only DNS over Tor was able to show efficient DNS Privacy in recent studies but even that can still be defeated by other means (see Your Anonymized Tor/VPN traffic.</p> <p>One could also decide to use a Tor Hidden DNS Service or ODoH (Oblivious DNS over HTTPS<sup>53</sup>) to further increase privacy/anonymity but unfortunately, as far as we know, these methods are only provided by Cloudflare as of this writing (https://blog.cloudflare.com/welcome-hidden-resolver/ <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>, https://blog.cloudflare.com/oblivious-dns/ <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>). These are workable and reasonably secure technical options but there is also a moral choice if you want to use Cloudflare or not (despite the risk posed by some researchers<sup>54</sup>).</p> <p>Note that Oblivious DNS addresses an adversary that eavesdrops on one of the connections listed here but not all. It does not address a global passive adversary (GPA) who can eavesdrop on many or all of these connections: - traffic between the client resolver and the recursive resolver - the recursive resolver and the ODNS resolver - the ODNS resolver and an authoritative server.</p> <p>Lastly, there is also this new possibility called DoHoT which stands for DNS over HTTPS over Tor which could also further increase your privacy/anonymity and which you could consider if you are more skilled with Linux. See https://github.com/alecmuffett/dohot <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>. This guide will not help you with this one at this stage, but it might be coming soon.</p> <p>Here is an illustration showing the current state of DNS and HTTPS privacy based on our current knowledge.</p> <p></p> <p>As for your normal daily use (non-sensitive), remember that only Firefox-based browsers support ECH (formerly eSNI) so far and that it is only useful with websites hosted behind Cloudflare CDN at this stage. If you prefer a Chrome-based version (which is understandable for some due to some better-integrated features like on-the-fly Translation), then we would recommend the use of Brave instead which supports all Chrome extensions and offers much better privacy than Chrome.</p> <p>But the story does not stop there right. Now because after all this, even if you encrypt your DNS and use all possible mitigations. Simple IP requests to any server will probably allow an adversary to still detect which site you are visiting. And this is simply because the majority of websites have unique IPs tied to them as explained here: https://blog.apnic.net/2019/08/23/what-can-you-learn-from-an-ip-address/ <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>. This means that an adversary can create a dataset of known websites for instance including their IPs and then match this dataset against the IP you ask for. In most cases, this will result in a correct guess of the website you are visiting. This means that despite OCSP stapling, despite ECH/eSNI, despite using Encrypted DNS ... An adversary can still guess the website you are visiting anyway.</p> <p>Therefore, to mitigate all these issues (as much as possible and as best as we can), this guide will later recommend two solutions: Using Tor and a virtualized (See Appendix W: Virtualization) multi-layered solution of VPN over Tor solution (DNS over VPN over Tor or DNS over TOR). Other options will also be explained (Tor over VPN, VPN only, No Tor/VPN) but are less recommended.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#your-rfid-enabled-devices","title":"Your RFID enabled devices","text":"<p>RFID stands for Radio-frequency identification<sup>55</sup>, it is the technology used for instance for contactless payments and various identification systems.

The Tor Project itself published an article about these attacks with some mitigations: https://blog.torproject.org/new-low-cost-traffic-analysis-attacks-mitigations <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Correlation Timing Attacks: As illustrated (simplified) below, an adversary that has access to network connection logs (IP or DNS for instance, remember that most VPN servers and most Tor nodes are known and publicly listed) at the source and the destination could correlate the timings to de-anonymize you without requiring any access to the Tor or VPN network in between. A real use case of this technique was done by the FBI in 2013 to de-anonymize<sup>73</sup> a bomb threat hoax at Harvard University.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Correlation Counting Attacks: As illustrated (simplified) below, an adversary that has no access to detailed connection logs (cannot see that you used Tor or Netflix) but has access to data counting logs could see that you have downloaded 600MB on a specific time/date that matches the 600MB upload at the destination. This correlation can then be used to de-anonymize you over time.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>There are ways to mitigate these such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Do not use Tor/VPNs to access services that are on the same network (ISP) as the destination service. For example, do not connect to Tor from your University Network to access a University Service anonymously. Instead, use a different source point (such as a public Wi-Fi) that cannot be correlated easily by an adversary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not use Tor/VPN from an obviously heavily monitored network (such as a corporate/governmental network) but instead try to find an unmonitored network such as a public Wi-Fi or a residential Wi-Fi.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the use of multiple layers (such as what will be recommended in this guide later: VPN over Tor) so that an adversary might be able to see that someone connected to the service through Tor but will not be able to see that it was you because you were connected to a VPN and not the Tor Network.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Be aware again that this might not be enough against a motivated global adversary<sup>74</sup> with wide access to global mass surveillance. Such an adversary might have access to logs no matter where you are and could use those to de-anonymize you. Usually, these attacks are part of what is called a Sybil Attack<sup>75</sup>. These adversaries are out of the scope of this guide.</p> <p>Be also aware that all the other methods described in this guide such as Behavioral analysis can also be used to deanonymize Tor users indirectly (also see Your Digital Footprint.</p> <p>I also strongly recommend reading this very good, complete, and thorough (and more detailed) guide on most known Attack Vectors on Tor: https://github.com/Attacks-on-Tor/Attacks-on-Tor <sup>[Archive.org]</sup> as well as this recent research publication https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323627387_Shedding_Light_on_the_Dark_Corners_of_the_Internet_A_Survey_of_Tor_Research <sup>[Archive.org]</sup></p> <p>As well as this great series of blog posts: https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/906-Tor-0day-The-Management-Vulnerability.html <sup>[Archive.org]</sup></p> <p>Recently, one of these attacks was attempted on the Tor Network with more information here: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/07/active-attack-on-tor-network-tried-to-decloak-users-for-five-months/ <sup>[Archive.org]</sup></p> <p>Lastly, do remember that using Tor can already be considered suspicious activity<sup>76</sup>, and its use could be considered malicious by some<sup>77</sup>.</p> <p>This guide will later propose some mitigations to such attacks by changing your origin from the start (using public wi-fi's for instance).

This number is known and tracked by the cell phone operators and known by the manufacturers. Every time your phone connects to the mobile network, it will register the IMEI on the network along with the IMSI (if a SIM card is inserted but that is not even needed). It is also used by many applications (Banking apps abusing the phone permission on Android for instance<sup>86</sup>) and smartphone Operating Systems (Android/IOS) for identification of the device<sup>87</sup>. It is possible but difficult (and not illegal in many jurisdictions<sup>88</sup>) to change the IMEI on a phone but it is probably easier and cheaper to just find and buy some old (working) Burner phone for a few Euros (this guide is for Germany remember) at a flea market or some random small shop.</p> <p>The IMSI is tied directly to the mobile subscription or pre-paid plan you are using and is tied to your phone number by your mobile provider. The IMSI is hardcoded directly on the SIM card and cannot be changed. Remember that every time your phone connects to the mobile network, it will also register the IMSI on the network along with the IMEI. Like the IMEI, the IMSI is also being used by some applications and smartphone Operating systems for identification and is being tracked. Some countries in the EU for instance maintain a database of IMEI/IMSI associations for easy querying by Law Enforcement.</p> <p>Today, giving away your (real) phone number is the same or better than giving away your Social Security number/Passport ID/National ID.</p> <p>The IMEI and IMSI can be traced back to you in at least six ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The mobile operator subscriber logs will usually store the IMEI along with the IMSI and their subscriber information database. If you use a prepaid anonymous SIM (anonymous IMSI but with a known IMEI), they could see this cell belongs to you if you used that cell phone before with a different SIM card (different anonymous IMSI but same known IMEI).</p> </li> <li> <p>The mobile operator antenna logs will conveniently keep a log of which IMEI. IMSI also keep some connection data. They know and log for instance that a phone with this IMEI/IMSI combination connected to a set of mobile antennas and how powerful the signal to each of those antennas were, allowing easy triangulation/geolocation of the signal. They also know which other phones (your real one for instance) connected at the same time to the same antennas with the same signal. This makes it possible to know precisely that this \"burner phone\" was always connected at the same place/time than this other \"known phone\" which shows up every time the burner phone is being used. This information can/is used by various third parties to geolocate/track you quite precisely<sup>89</sup>'<sup>90</sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The manufacturer of the Phone can trace back the sale of the phone using the IMEI if that phone was bought in a non-anonymous way. Indeed, they will have logs of each phone sale (including serial number and IMEI), to which shop/person to whom it was sold. And if you are using a phone that you bought online (or from someone that knows you). It can be traced to you using that information. Even if they do not find you on CCTV<sup>91</sup> and you bought the phone using cash, they can still find what other phone (your real one in your pocket) was there (in that shop) at that time/date by using the antenna logs.</p> </li> <li> <p>The IMSI alone can be used to find you as well because most countries now require customers to provide an ID when buying a SIM card (subscription or pre-paid). The IMSI is then tied to the identity of the buyer of the card. In the countries where the SIM can still be bought with cash (like the UK), they still know where (which shop) it was bought and when. This information can then be used to retrieve information from the shop itself (such as CCTV footage as for the IMEI case). Or again the antenna logs can also be used to figure out which other phone was there at the moment of the sale.</p> </li> <li> <p>The smartphone OS makers (Google/Apple for Android/IOs) also keep logs of IMEI/IMSI identifications tied to Google/Apple accounts and which user has been using them. They too can trace back the history of the phone and to which accounts it was tied in the past<sup>92</sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Government agencies around the world interested in your phone number can and do use<sup>93</sup> special devices called \"IMSI catchers\"<sup>94</sup> like the Stingray<sup>95</sup> or more recently the Nyxcell<sup>96</sup>. These devices can impersonate (to spoof) a cell phone Antenna and force a specific IMSI (your phone) to connect to it to access the cell network. Once they do, they will be able to use various MITM<sup>97</sup> (Man-In-The-Middle Attacks) that will allow them to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tap your phone (voice calls and SMS).</p> </li> <li> <p>Sniff and examine your data traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Impersonate your phone number without controlling your phone.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Here is also a good YouTube video on this topic: DEFCON Safe Mode - Cooper Quintin - Detecting Fake 4G Base Stations in Real-Time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siCk4pGGcqA <sup>[Invidious]</sup></p> <p>For these reasons, it is crucial to get a dedicated anonymous phone number and/or an anonymous burner phone with a cash-bought pre-paid sim card that is not tied to you in any way (past or present) for conducting sensitive activities. It is also possible to get an anonymous pre-paid but preferably dedicated number from free and paid online services accepting anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero. Get more practical guidance here: [Getting an anonymous Phone number][Getting an anonymous Phone number:].</p> <p>While there are some smartphones manufacturers like Purism with their Librem series<sup>98</sup> who claim to have your privacy in mind, they still do not allow IMEI randomization which we believe is a key anti-tracking feature that should be provided by such manufacturers. While this measure will not prevent IMSI tracking within the SIM card, it would at least allow you to keep the same \"burner phone\" and only switch SIM cards instead of having to switch both for privacy.</p> <p>See Appendix N: Warning about smartphones and smart devices</p>"},{"location":"guide/#your-wi-fi-or-ethernet-mac-address","title":"Your Wi-Fi or Ethernet MAC address","text":"<p>The MAC address<sup>99</sup> is a unique identifier tied to your physical Network Interface (Wired Ethernet or Wi-Fi) and could of course be used to track you if it is not randomized. As it was the case with the IMEI, manufacturers of computers and network cards usually keep logs of their sales (usually including things like serial number, IMEI, Mac Addresses, ...) and it is possible again for them to track where and when the computer with the MAC address in question was sold and to whom. Even if you bought it with cash in a supermarket, the supermarket might still have CCTV (or a CCTV just outside that shop) and again the time/date of sale could be used to find out who was there using the Mobile Provider antenna logs at that time (IMEI/IMSI).</p> <p>Operating Systems makers (Google/Microsoft/Apple) will also keep logs of devices and their MAC addresses in their logs for device identification (Find my device type services for example). Apple can tell that the MacBook with this specific MAC address was tied to a specific Apple Account before. Maybe yours before you decided to use the MacBook for sensitive activities. Maybe to a different user who sold it to you but remembers your e-mail/number from when the sale happened.</p> <p>Your home router/Wi-Fi access point keeps logs of devices that are registered on the Wi-Fi, and these can be accessed too to find out who has been using your Wi-Fi. Sometimes this can be done remotely (and silently) by the ISP depending on if that router/Wi-Fi access point is being \"managed\" remotely by the ISP (which is often the case when they provide the router to their customers).</p> <p>Some commercial devices will keep a record of MAC addresses roaming around for various purposes such as road congestion<sup>100</sup>.</p> <p>So, it is important again not to bring your phone along when/where you conduct sensitive activities. If you use your own laptop, then it is crucial to hide that MAC address (and Bluetooth address) anywhere you use it and be extra careful not to leak any information. Thankfully many recent OSes now feature or allow the possibility to randomize MAC addresses (Android, IOS, Linux, and Windows 10/11) with the notable exception of macOS which does not support this feature even in its latest Big Sur version.</p> <p>See Appendix N: Warning about smartphones and smart devices</p>"},{"location":"guide/#your-bluetooth-mac-address","title":"Your Bluetooth MAC address","text":"<p>Your Bluetooth MAC is like the earlier MAC address except it is for Bluetooth.

Some commercial services such as TypingDNA (https://www.typingdna.com/ <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>) even offer such analysis as a replacement for two-factor authentications.</p> </li> <li> <p>This technology is also widely used in CAPTCHAS<sup>370</sup> services to verify that you are \"human\" and can be used to fingerprint a user.</p> </li> <li> <p>See Appendix A4: Counteracting Forensic Linguistics.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Analysis algorithms could then be used to match these patterns with other users and match you to a different known user.

The issue is mainly when you want to convert Fiat money (Euros, Dollars ...) to Crypto and then when you want to cash in your Crypto. You will have few realistic options but to transfer those to an exchange (such as Coinbase/Kraken/Bitstamp/Binance). Those exchanges have known wallet addresses and will keep detailed logs (due to KYC<sup>240</sup> financial regulations) and can then trace back those crypto transactions to you using the financial system<sup>241</sup>.</p> <p>There are some cryptocurrencies with privacy/anonymity in mind like Monero but even those have some and warnings to consider<sup>242</sup>'<sup>243</sup>.</p> <p>Use of \"private\" mixers, tumblers<sup>244</sup> (centralized services that specialize in \"anonymizing\" cryptocurrencies by \"mixing them\") and coinjoiners are risky as you don't know what's happening on them<sup>245</sup> and can be trivially de-mixed<sup>246</sup>. Their centrally-controlled nature could also put you in trouble as they are more susceptible to money-laundering laws<sup>247</sup>.</p> <p>This does not mean you cannot use Bitcoin anonymously at all. You can actually use Bitcoin anonymously as long as you do not convert it to actual currency, use a Bitcoin wallet from a safe anonymous network, and do not reuse addresses or consolidate outputs that were used when spending at different merchants. Meaning you should avoid KYC/AML regulations by various exchanges, avoid using the Bitcoin network from any known IP address, and use a wallet that provides privacy-preserving tools. See [Appendix Z: Online anonymous payments using cryptocurrencies][Appendix Z: Online anonymous payments using cryptocurrencies].</p> <p>Overall, the best option for using Crypto with reasonable anonymity and privacy is still Monero and you should ideally not use any other for sensitive transactions unless you are aware of the limitations and risks involved.

For example, an attacker trying to track the activities of a journalist can use that journalist's public Twitter handle to link their anonymous identities with their public one. This breaks compartmentalization of identities and can lead to complete deanonymization, even of users who practice proper OPSEC.</p> <p>The attack, published at https://leakuidatorplusteam.github.io/ <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>, can be mitigated using the well-known NoScript extension and will be our preferred recommendation.</p> <p>One loosely documented attack might take the following approach to fingerprinting: Alice is browsing the web using Firefox. The website she has just visited is using an invisible <code>iframe</code> that creates long strings, e.g., sentences or hashes, to produce some non-user-viewable string. These strings are setting a certain font type, Arial. Whether the browser renders this is non-essential, it only matters if the font changes. The <code>iframe</code> in this case serves no purpose but to identify whether a user has installed a certain font on their machine. If Alice is using a font that this frame has tried to render, then it is reported back to the website and to the person in control of the website.</p> <p>The font renders a box with a specific height and width around itself, so that means a specific height and width of the text contained within. The <code>iframe</code> keeps doing this for each installed font to create a list of installed fonts for Alice. Because of stylistic differences between each font family, the same string and the same font size will add up to a different height and a different width than Arial. It is used as a fallback font to display text that won't display otherwise, in the case of a user not having that font on their machine and thus non-viewable from their browser.</p> <p>If a font requested by an <code>iframe</code> is not available, Arial will be used to show that text to the user. Every time the font measurement (identified by the dimensions of the box produced) changed, it means the font is present on Alice's browser and her machine. By doing this for hundreds of fonts, websites can use this information to track users using their installed fonts across websites. Imagine a website then selling this \u201canonymized\u201d information as a dataset to advertisement companies to serve you ads based on the websites you visit, because they know every font you have installed on your machine and can now track your identity across the internet. This attack is demonstrated here: Everything you always wanted to know about web-based device fingerprinting (but were afraid to ask) by Dr. Nick Nikiforakis, PhD in Computer Science from KU Leuven. He explains how his team of researchers identified which sites were using such techniques on Alexa's top 10,000 websites. Primarily, they found that of those, 145 were fingerprinting browsers. They were fingerprinted 100% of the time \u2014 whether they were using the Do Not Track header, a popular Privacy &amp; Security setting in many browsers, did not matter.</p> <p>Attacks such as invisible iframes and media elements can be avoided by blocking all scripts globally by using something like uBlock Origin https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm or by using NoScript https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm.

In short, it is a UEFI security feature designed to prevent your computer from booting an operating system from which the bootloader was not signed by specific keys stored in the UEFI firmware of your laptop.</p> <p>When the operating system (or the Bootloader<sup>307</sup>) supports it, you can store the keys of your bootloader in your UEFI firmware, and this will prevent booting up any unauthorized Operating System (such as a live OS USB or anything similar).</p> <p>Secure Boot settings are protected by the password you set up to access the BIOS/UEFI settings. If you have that password, you can disable Secure Boot and allow unsigned OSes to boot on your system. This can help mitigate some Evil-Maid attacks (explained later in this guide).</p> <p>In most cases, Secure Boot is disabled by default or is enabled but in \"setup\" mode which will allow any system to boot. For Secure Boot to work, your Operating System will have to support it and then sign its bootloader and push those signing keys to your UEFI firmware. After that, you will have to go to your BIOS/UEFI settings and save those pushed keys from your OS and change the Secure Boot from setup to user mode (or custom mode in some cases).</p> <p>After doing that step, only the Operating Systems from which your UEFI firmware can verify the integrity of the bootloader will be able to boot.</p> <p>Most laptops will have some default keys already stored in the secure boot settings. Usually, those are from the manufacturer itself or some companies such as Microsoft. So, this means that by default, it will always be possible to boot some USB disks even with secure boot. These include Windows, Fedora, Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, CentOS, OpenSUSE, Tails, Clonezilla, and many others. Secure Boot is however not supported at all by Qubes OS at this point.</p> <p>In some laptops, you can manage those keys and remove the ones you do not want with a \"custom mode\" to only authorize your bootloader that you could sign yourself if you want to.</p> <p>So, what is Secure Boot protecting you from? It will protect your laptop from booting unsigned bootloaders (by the OS provider) with for instance injected malware.</p> <p>What is Secure Boot not protecting you from?</p> <ul> <li> <p>Secure Boot is not encrypting your disk and an adversary can still just remove the disk from your laptop and extract data from it using a different machine. Secure Boot is therefore useless without full disk encryption.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secure Boot is not protecting you from a signed bootloader that would be compromised and signed by the manufacturer itself (Microsoft for example in the case of Windows). Most mainstream Linux distributions are signed these days and will boot with Secure Boot enabled.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secure Boot can have flaws and exploits like any other system. If you are running an old laptop that does not benefit from new BIOS/UEFI updates, these can be left unfixed.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Additionally, several attacks could be possible against Secure Boot as explained (in-depth) in these technical videos:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Defcon 22, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDSlWa9xQuA <sup>[Invidious]</sup></p> </li> <li> <p>BlackHat 2016, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fZdL3ufVOI <sup>[Invidious]</sup></p> </li> </ul> <p>So, it can be useful as an added measure against some adversaries but not all.

Windows is also unfortunately at the same time a privacy nightmare<sup>312</sup> but is the only easy to set up option for using OS-wide plausible deniability. Windows telemetry and telemetry blocking are also widely documented which should mitigate many issues.</p> <p>So, what is Plausible Deniability? You can cooperate with an adversary requesting access to your device/data without revealing your true secret. All this using Deniable Encryption<sup>313</sup>.</p> <p>A soft lawful adversary could ask for your encrypted laptop password. At first, you could refuse to give out any password (using your \"right to remain silent\", \"right not to incriminate yourself\") but some countries are implementing laws<sup>314</sup>'<sup>315</sup> to exempt this from such rights (because terrorists and \"think of the children\"). In that case, you might have to reveal the password or face jail time in contempt of court. This is where plausible deniability will come into play.</p> <p>You could then reveal a password, but that password will only give access to \"plausible data\" (a decoy OS). The forensics will be well aware that it is possible for you to have hidden data but should not be able to prove this (if you do this right). You will have cooperated, and the investigators will have access to something but not what you actually want to hide. Since the burden of proof should lie on their side, they will have no options but to believe you unless they have proof that you have hidden data.</p> <p>This feature can be used at the OS level (a plausible OS and a hidden OS) or at the files level where you will have an encrypted file container (similar to a zip file) where different files will be shown depending on the encryption password you use.</p> <p>This also means you could set up your own advanced \"plausible deniability\" setup using any Host OS by storing for instance Virtual Machines on a Veracrypt hidden volume container (be careful of traces in the Host OS tho that would need to be cleaned if the host OS is persistent, see [Some additional measures against forensics][Some additional measures against forensics:] section later). There is a project for achieving this within Tails (https://github.com/aforensics/HiddenVM <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>) which would make your Host OS non-persistent and use plausible deniability within Tails.</p> <p>In the case of Windows, plausible deniability is also the reason you should ideally have Windows 10/11 Home (and not Pro). This is because Windows 10/11 Pro natively offers a full-disk encryption system (Bitlocker<sup>316</sup>) where Windows 10/11 Home offers no full-disk encryption at all. You will later use third-party open-source software for encryption that will allow full-disk encryption on Windows 10/11 Home. This will give you a good (plausible) excuse to use this software. While using this software on Windows 10/11 Pro would be suspicious.</p> <p>Note about Linux: So, what about Linux and plausible deniability?

Especially check this before applying large Windows updates that might break the Veracrypt bootloader and send you into a boot loop.</p> <p>NOTE THAT BY DEFAULT VERACRYPT WILL ALWAYS PROPOSE A SYSTEM PASSWORD IN QWERTY (display the password as a test). This can cause issues if your boot input is using your laptop's keyboard (AZERTY for example) as you will have set up your password in QWERTY and will input it at boot time in AZERTY. So, make sure you check when doing the test boot what keyboard layout your BIOS is using. You could fail to log in just because of the QWERTY/AZERTY mix-up.

If your goal however is to use the same identity at each session on the same authenticated services, the value of Stream isolation is lessened as you can be correlated through other means.</p> <p>You should also know that Stream Isolation is not necessarily configured by default on Whonix Workstation. It is only pre-configured for some applications (including Tor Browser).</p> <p>Also, note that Stream Isolation does not necessarily change all the nodes in your Tor circuit.

This means that you will connect the Host OS to a first VPN from your Public Wi-Fi, then Whonix will connect to Tor, and finally, your VM will connect to a second VPN over Tor over VPN (see https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_a_VPN_before_Tor <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>).</p> <p>This will of course have a significant performance impact and might be quite slow, but Tor is necessary somewhere for achieving reasonable anonymity.</p> <p>Achieving this technically is easy within this route, you need two separate anonymous VPN accounts and must connect to the first VPN from the Host OS and follow the route.</p> <p>Conclusion: Only do this if you think using Tor alone is risky/impossible but VPNs are okay.

Qubes OS leverages and extensively uses Xen-based virtualization to allow for the creation and management of isolated compartments called Qubes.</p> <p>Qubes OS is not a Linux distribution<sup>361</sup> but a Xen distribution. It is different from Linux distributions because it will make extensive use of Virtualization and Compartmentalization so that any app will run in a different VM (Qube). As a bonus, Qubes OS integrates Whonix by default and allows for increased privacy and anonymity. It is highly recommended that you document yourself over Qubes OS principles before going this route.

But it has some downsides such as the lack of OS-wide plausible deniability, its hardware requirements, and its hardware compatibility. While you can run this on 4GB of RAM as per their requirements <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>, the recommended RAM is 16GB. We would recommend against using Qubes OS if you have less than 8GB of RAM. If you want a comfortable experience, you should have 16GB, if you want a particularly enjoyable experience, you should have 24GB or 32GB.</p> <p>The reason for this RAM requirement is that each app will run in a different VM and each of those VM will require and allocate a certain amount of memory that will not be available for other apps. If you are running native Windows apps within Qubes OS Qubes, the ram overhead will be significant.</p> <p>You should also check their hardware compatibility here https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/ <sup>[Archive.org]</sup> before proceeding. Your mileage might vary, and you might experience several issues about hardware compatibility that you will have to troubleshoot and solve yourself.</p> <p>I think that if you can afford it and are comfortable with the idea of using Linux, you should go with this route as it is probably the best one in terms of security and privacy.

How are attributions determined? During digital forensic and incident response (DFIR), analysts typically look for indicators of compromise (IoCs) following events that call them to act. These indicators usually consist of IP addresses, names, databases; all of which can prescribe a certain behavioral \"tag\" to an individual or group. This is called attribution. A principal in statistics is that \"correlation does not infer causality\". What this means is that, while you may leave certain traces on certain areas of a device or network, that only shows presence of action, i.e., not explicitly your presence. It doesn't show who you are, it only resolves that something occurred and someone has done something.</p> <p>Attribution is required to prove fault or guilt, and is the prime reason why people using the Tor network to access the dark web have been compromised: they left traces that were shown to be connected to their real identities. Your IP can be \u2014 but is usually not \u2014 a large enough indicator to attribute guilt. This is shown in the infamous NotPetya cyber attacks against the U.S., which were later also released upon Ukraine. Though the White House never said it was Russia's doing, they attributed the attack to Russia's (GRU) which is a direct office housing the Russian deniable warfare<sup>310</sup> cyber divisions, uncommonly referred to as \"spy makers\" in the intelligence community (IC).</p> <p>What is the point, you may ask? Well, bluntly speaking, this a perfect example because NotPetya, which is now undoubtedly the work of Russian cyber operations against foreign countries and governments, has still never been formally attributed to Russia, only to a known group within Russia (colloquially dubbed Cozy Bear) which can not be confirmed nor denied given that it is highly compartmentalized within the structure of Russia's military. And it's also in part because of the efforts used to disguise itself as a common Ransomware, and because it routinely used the servers of hacked foreign assets not linked to Russia or to its internal networks.</p> <p>It's all to show you the lengths that state actors will go to. You may not be aware of it, but foreign governments use concealment techniques such as the ones discussed in the sections of this guide. They routinely use Tor, VPNs to conceal traffic; they use hacked devices and access to stolen equipment to perform cyber espionage every day and it makes attribution incredibly difficult, if not improbable, from a forensic examiner's point of view. The problem of correlation is trivial, and you can solve it by simply using IP hiding tools such as a VPN and the Tor network, but still be connected to your IRL name and IP through data leaks or other factors. You can not easily be attributed to your activities if you carefully follow and adopt the given techniques and skills discussed below.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#creating-your-anonymous-online-identities","title":"Creating your anonymous online identities","text":""},{"location":"guide/#methodology-to-prevent-anonymity","title":"Methodology to Prevent Anonymity","text":"<p>If you often use VPNs or Tor, you will quickly encounter many captchas everywhere.

Platforms seem to be more lenient in not imposing restrictions on new younger audiences.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sex/Gender is important, and you will have fewer issues if you are a female than if you are a male.</p> </li> <li> <p>Country of origin is important, and you will have fewer issues if your identity is Norwegian than if it is Ukrainian, Nigerian, or Mexican.</p> </li> <li> <p>Country of residence is important, and you will have fewer issues if your identity has its residence in Oslo or Paris than if you decide to live in Kyiv or Cairo.</p> </li> <li> <p>Language is important and you will have fewer issues if you speak English or the language of your Identity than if you use a non-related language. Do not make a Norwegian-born Arabic 20-year-old female that speaks Ukrainian or Arabic.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Identities that are \"EU residents\" with an \"EU IP\" (VPN/Tor Exit IP) will benefit from GDPR protections on many platforms.

GDPR is your friend in most cases, and you should take this into account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Similarly, origin IP geolocation (your IP/location when you go to \"whatsmyipaddress.com\") should match your identity location as much as possible (When using a VPN over Tor, you can pick this in the VPN client if you use the VPN over Tor approach or just create a new identity in Tor Browser or Brave Tor Tab until you get an appropriate Exit node, or configure Tor to restrict your Exit Nodes). Consider excluding any exit IP that is not located in Western Europe/US/Canada/Japan/South Korea/Australia/New Zealand as you will have fewer issues. Ideally, you should get a European Union IP to get additional GDPR protection and if possible, a German exit IP due to their legal stance on using anonymous accounts on online platforms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Brave Browser (Chromium-based) with a Private Tor Tab has a better acceptance level than Tor Browser (Firefox based).

Be consistent.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use a different phone number for each identity. Online platforms do keep track of phone number usage and if one identity/number gets flagged for violating Community Guidelines or Terms of Services, it might also get the other identities using the same number flagged/banned as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adapt your language/writing to the identity to not raise suspicions and lower your chances of being fingerprinted by online platforms.

In most cases, you'll just have a random error at sign-up and your account suspended after sign-in.\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>But this clause of their ToS is illegal in Germany (see [Requirements][Pre-requisites and limitations:]).</p> <p>Facebook is one of the most aggressive platforms with identity verification and is pushing hard their \"real name policy\". It is why this guide is only advised to German residents.</p> <p>Over our tests tho we were able to pinpoint a few tips:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It will be easier if you have an Instagram account first.</p> </li> <li> <p>Signing up through Tor is almost impossible (even using their .onion address which is a joke) and will only succeed if you are \" very lucky\" (I assume if you are using an exit node that is not yet known by Facebook verification systems). In most cases, it will not allow registration at all and will just fail with \"An error has occurred during registration\".</p> </li> <li> <p>Signing up through VPNs is more likely to succeed but might still result in the same error. So, you must be ready for a lot of trial and error here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Signing up through a Self-Hosted VPN/Proxy is your best bet but make sure your profile/identity matches the IP geolocation.</p> </li> <li> <p>My earlier entry in the guide about the Orwellian quote from Animal Farm is in full effect on Facebook. You will experience huge variation in acceptance depending on age/sex/ethnicity/nationality/... This is where you will have far fewer issues if you are making an account of a Young European Caucasian Female. You will almost certainly fail if you try making a Middle-Aged Male where my other accounts are still unsuspended/unbanned to this day.</p> </li> <li> <p>Logging-in (after you sign-up) however works fine with VPN and Tor but might still trigger an account suspension for violating Community Guidelines or Terms of Services (despite you not using the account at all for anything else than signing-up/logging-in). Ideally, you should log-in back with the same IP from a self-hosted VPN/Proxy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I also suspect strongly based on my test that the following points have an impact on your likelihood of being suspended over time:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Not having friends</p> </li> <li> <p>Not having interests and an \"organic activity\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Not being in the contacts of any other user</p> </li> <li> <p>Not being on other platforms (such as Instagram/WhatsApp)</p> </li> <li> <p>Restricting your profile privacy settings too soon after signing-up</p> </li> </ul> <p>If your account gets suspended, you will need to appeal the decision through a quite simple form that will require you to submit a \"proof of ID\". However, that proof of ID verification system is more lenient than LinkedIn and will allow you to send various documents which require far less Photoshop skills.</p> <p>It is also possible that they ask you to take a selfie video or picture-making certain gestures to prove your identity. If that is the case, we are afraid it is a dead-end for now unless you use a deepfake face swapping technique.</p> <p>If you do file an appeal, you will have to wait for Facebook to review it (I do not know whether this is automatic or human) and you will have to wait and hope for them to unsuspend your account.</p> <p>GitHub</p> <ul> <li> <p>Is this against their ToS?

There is no escape here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can you create accounts through Tor? Yes, but expect some captchas and your phone number will be required</p> </li> </ul> <p>Proton is good ... but to appear less suspicious, it is simply better to also have a mainstream Google Mail account.</p> <p>As Proton, Google will also most likely require a phone number during sign-up as part of their verification process. However contrary to Proton, Google will store that phone number during the sign-up process and will also limit the number of accounts that can be created during the sign-up<sup>398</sup>'<sup>399</sup>.</p> <p>From my experience during my research, this count is limited to three accounts/phone numbers. If you are unlucky with your number (if it was previously used by another mobile user), it might be less.</p> <p>You should therefore use again your online phone number OR your burner phone and pre-paid SIM card to create the account. Do not forget to use the identity details you made up earlier (birthdate). When the account is created, please do take some time to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>(Trick) Log into Google Mail on desktop and go into the Gmail Quick Settings &gt; See all Setting &gt; Forwarding and POP/IMAP &gt; Add a forwarding address &gt; Verify (using Proton) &gt; Go back to Gmail and set the forwarding to forward and delete Google copy &gt; Save. This step will allow you to check your Google Mail using Proton instead and will allow you to avoid triggering Google Security checks by Logging in from various VPN/Tor exit IP addresses in the future while storing your sensitive e-mail at Proton instead. This trick will allow you to receive all the e-mails from your Gmail addresses on your Proton (or other) address without needing to login into your Google accounts (reducing risks of it being suspended, especially if you use Tor).</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable 2FA within the Google account settings. First, you will have to enable 2FA using the phone number. Then you will see the option appear to enable 2FA using an Authenticator app. Use that option and set it up with a new KeePassXC TOTP entry. When it is done, remove the phone 2FA from the Google account. This will prevent someone from using that phone number in the future (when you do not have it anymore) to recover/gain access to that account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add Proton as a recovery e-mail address for the account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove the phone number from the account details as a recovery option.</p> </li> <li> <p>Upload a Google profile picture you made earlier during the identity creation step.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review the Google Privacy settings to disable as much as you can:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Activity logging</p> </li> <li> <p>YouTube</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Log out and do not touch it unless needed (as mentioned, you will use Proton to check your Gmail).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Keep in mind that there are different algorithms in place to check for weird activity. If you receive any mail (on Proton) prompting about a Google Security Warning. Click it and click the button to say, \"Yes it was me\". It helps.</p> <p>Do not use that account for \"sign-up with Google\" anywhere unless necessary.</p> <p>Be extremely careful if you decide to use the account for Google activities (such as Google Maps reviews or YouTube Comments) as those can easily trigger some checks (Negative reviews, Comments breaking Community Guidelines on YouTube).</p> <p>If your account gets suspended <sup>400</sup> (this can happen on sign-up, after signing-up or after using it in some Google services), you can still get it unsuspended by submitting<sup>401</sup> an appeal/verification (which will again require your Phone number and possibly an e-mail contact with Google support with the reason). Suspension of the account does not disable the e-mail forwarding, but the suspended account will be deleted after a while.</p> <p>After suspension, if your Google account is restored, you should be fine.</p> <p>If your account gets banned, you will have no appeal and the forwarding will be disabled. Your phone number will be flagged, and you will not be able to use it to sign-up on a different account. Be careful when using those to avoid losing them. They are precious.</p> <p>It is also possible that Google will require an ID check through indirect financial KYC or ID picture check if you try to access/publish mature content on their platform<sup>402</sup>.</p> <p>Instagram</p> <ul> <li>Is this against their ToS? Maybe? We are not sure https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870?ref=dp <sup>[Archive.org]</sup></li> </ul> <p>\"You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.

If that is the case, we are afraid it is a dead-end for now.</p> <p>It is no secret that Instagram is part of Facebook however it is more lenient than Facebook when it comes to user verification. It is quite unlikely you will get suspended or banned after signing up. But it could help.</p> <p>For instance, we noticed that you will face fewer issues creating a Facebook account if you already have a valid Instagram account. You should always create an Instagram account before trying Facebook.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are some limitations when using the web version of Instagram. For instance, you will not be able to enable Authenticator 2FA from the web for a reason we do not know.</p> <p>After sign-up, do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Upload a picture of your generated identity if you want.</p> </li> <li> <p>Go into your Settings</p> </li> <li> <p>Make the account private (initially at least)</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not show activity status</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not allow sharing</p> </li> </ul> <p>Jami</p> <ul> <li> <p>Is this against their ToS?

Yes, but expect some captchas and your phone number will be required</p> </li> </ul> <p>LinkedIn is far less aggressive than twitter but will nonetheless require a valid e-mail (preferably again your Gmail) and a phone number in most cases (tho not always).</p> <p>LinkedIn however is relying a lot on reports and user/customer moderation. You should not create a profile with an occupation inside a private corporation or a small startup company. The company employees are monitoring LinkedIn activity and receive notifications when new people join. They can then report your profile as fake, and your profile will then be suspended or banned pending appeal.</p> <p>LinkedIn will then require you to go through a verification process that will, unfortunately, require you to send an ID proof (identity card, passport, driver's license). This ID verification is processed by a company called Jumio<sup>403</sup> that specializes in ID proofing. This is most likely a dead end as this would force you to develop some strong Photoshop skills.</p> <p>Instead, you are far less likely to be reported if you just stay vague (say you are a student/intern/freelance) or pretend you work for a large public institution that is too large for anyone to care or check.</p> <p>As with Twitter and Google, you should do the following after signing up:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Disable ads</p> </li> <li> <p>Disable notifications</p> </li> <li> <p>Disable lookup by phone/e-mail</p> </li> <li> <p>Upload a picture of your identity</p> </li> </ul> <p>MailFence</p> <ul> <li> <p>Is this against their ToS?

If you use a VPN over Tor, they will likely only ask for an e-mail.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can you create accounts through Tor? Yes, you can but expect captchas, at least e-mail verification, and likely phone verification.</p> </li> </ul> <p>So yes, it is still possible to create an MS account without a phone number and using Tor or VPN, but you might have to cycle through a few exit nodes to achieve this.</p> <p>After signing up you should set up 2FA authentication within the security options and using KeePassXC TOTP.</p> <p>OnlyFans</p> <ul> <li> <p>Is this against their ToS?

You should sign-up using e-mail and password (not phone) and not using \"Sign-in with Google\". Use your Gmail as the e-mail address.</p> <p>More than likely, your account will be suspended immediately during the sign-up process and will require you to complete a series of automated tests to unlock. This will include a series of captchas, confirmation of your e-mail and Twitter handle, or other information. In some cases, it will also require your phone number.</p> <p>In some cases, despite you selecting a text verification, the Twitter verification system will call the phone no matter what. In that case, you will have to pick up and hear the verification code. We suspect this is another method of preventing automated systems and malicious companies or entities from selling text receiving services over the internet.</p> <p>Twitter will store all this information and link it to your account including your IP, e-mail, and phone number.

As well as a reply confirming you have access to that e-mail.</p> <p>After a few days, your account should get unsuspended \"for good\".

This happens before you establish communication with the destination. The \"Forward\" refers to the future in time and means that every time you establish a new e2ee communication, a new set of keys will be generated for that specific session. The goal of forward secrecy is to maintain the secrecy of past communications (sessions) even if the current one is compromised. If an adversary manages to get hold of your current e2ee keys, that adversary will then be limited to the content of the single session and will not be able to easily decrypt past ones.</p> <p>This has some user experience drawbacks like for instance, a new device could not be able to conveniently access the remotely stored chat history without additional steps.</p> <p>So, in short, Forward Secrecy protects past sessions against future compromises of keys or passwords.</p> <p>More on this topic on this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSQtyW_ywZc <sup>[Invidious]</sup></p> <p>Some providers and apps claiming to offer e2ee do not offer FS/PFS sometimes for usability reasons (group messaging for instance is more complex with PFS).

At a high level, wear leveling works as follows. The space on every disk is divided into blocks that are themselves divided into pages, like the chapters in a book are made of pages. When a file is written to disk, it is assigned to a certain set of pages and blocks. If you wanted to overwrite the file in an HDD, then all you would have to do is tell the disk to overwrite those blocks. But in SSDs and USB drives, erasing and re-writing the same block can wear it out. Each block can only be erased and rewritten a limited number of times before that block just will not work anymore (the same way if you keep writing and erasing with a pencil and paper, eventually the paper might rip and be useless). To counteract this, SSDs and USB drives will try to make sure that the number of times each block has been erased and rewritten is about the same so that the drive will last as long as possible (thus the term wear leveling). As a side effect, sometimes instead of erasing and writing the block, a file was originally stored on, the drive will instead leave that block alone, mark it as invalid, and just write the modified file to a different block. This is like leaving the chapter in the book unchanged, writing the modified file on a different page, and then just updating the book's table of contents to point to the new location. All of this occurs at a very low level in the electronics of the disk, so the operating system does not even realize it has happened. This means, however, that even if you try to overwrite a file, there is no guarantee the drive will actually overwrite it, and that's why secure deletion with SSDs is so much harder.</p> <p>Wear-leveling alone can therefore be a disadvantage for security and an advantage for adversaries such as forensics examiners. This feature makes classic \"secure deletion\" counter-productive and useless and is why this feature was removed on some Operating Systems like macOS (as from version 10.11 El Capitan) where you could enable it before on the Recycle Bin.</p> <p>Most of those old secure deletion utilities were written with HDD in mind and have no control over wear-leveling and are completely pointless when using an SSD. Avoid them on an SSD drive.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#trim-operations","title":"Trim Operations","text":"<p>So, what now? Well here comes the Trim<sup>426</sup> operation. When you delete data on your SSD, your OS should support what is called a Trim operation command and could (should) issue this Trim command to the SSD drive periodically (daily, weekly, monthly...). This Trim command will then let know the SSD drive controller that there are pages within blocks containing data that are now free to be really deleted without deleting anything itself.</p> <p>Trim should be enabled by default on all modern Operating Systems detecting an SSD drive covered in this guide (macOS, Windows 10/11, Ubuntu, Qubes OS 4.1.x ...).</p> <p>If Trim operations are not done regularly (or at all), then the data is never deleted pro-actively and at some point, all the blocks and pages will be occupied by data. Your OS will not see this and will just see free space as you delete files, but your SSD controller will not (this is called Write Amplification<sup>427</sup>). This will then force the SSD controller to erase those pages and blocks on the fly which will reduce the write performance. This is because while your OS/SSD can write data to any free page in any bock, erasure is only possible on entire blocks, therefore, forcing your SSD to perform many operations to write new data. Overwriting is just not possible. This will defeat the wear-leveling system and cause performance degradation of your SSD over time. Every time you delete a file on an SSD, your OS should issue a Trim command along with the deletion to let the SSD controller know the pages containing the file data are now free for deletion.</p> <p>So, Trim itself does not delete any data but just marks it for deletion. Data deleted without using Trim (if Trim has been disabled/blocked/delayed for instance) will still be deleted at some point by the SSD garbage collection or if you want to overwrite what the OS sees at free space. But it might stick around for a bit longer than if you use Trim.</p> <p>Here is an illustration from Wikipedia showing how it works on an SSD drive:</p> <p></p> <p>As you can see in the above illustration, data (from a file) will be written to the four first pages of Block X. Later new data will be written to the remaining pages and the data from the first files will be marked as invalid (for instance by a Trim operation when deleting a file). As explained on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim_(computing) <sup>[Wikiless]</sup> <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>; the erase operation can only be done on entire blocks (and not on single pages).</p> <p>In addition to marking files for deletion (on reputable SSD drives), Trim usually makes those unreadable using a method called \"Deterministic Read After Trim\" or \"Deterministic Zeroes After Trim\". This means that if an adversary tries to read data from a trimmed page/block and somehow manages to disable garbage collection, the controller will not return any meaningful data.</p> <p>Trim is your ally and should always be enabled when using an SSD drive and should offer sufficient reasonable protection. And this is also the reason you should not use Veracrypt Plausible deniability on a Trim enabled SSD as this feature is incompatible with Trim<sup>428</sup>.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#garbage-collection","title":"Garbage Collection","text":"<p>Garbage collection<sup>429</sup> is an internal process running within your SSD drive that looks for data marked for erasure.

Tools like wipe or shred are often overkill, as they perform up to 35 passes. While they work, most SSDs require no more than a couple passes.</li> <li>Use <code>wipe</code> with only a couple passes: <code>wipe -qQ2 /dev/sdX</code>.<ul> <li><code>-qQ2</code> means 2 passes. Replace <code>2</code> with the desired number of passes.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Use <code>srm</code> with a 3-pass overwrite: <code>srm -P /dev/sdX</code>.</li> <li>Use <code>dd</code>: <code>dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX bs=8M status=progress conv=fsync</code>. This command will overwrite the drive with random data. To perform multiple passes (I recommend at least 2), simply run the command again until you're satisfied.<ul> <li>The reason you run it twice is because SSDs have hidden (\"overprovisioned\") storage which can contain remnants of deleted data. Wiping twice forces the drive to wipe its overprovisioned storage. This is only guaranteed to work if each pass writes different data (which is why we wipe with random data on each pass).</li> <li><code>bs=8M</code> writes 8MiB blocks at a time. This doesn't affect the quality of the data deletion, but adjusting it could affect how long it takes to wipe the drive.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>ATA/NVMe Secure Erase: This method will remove the mapping table that keeps track of allocated data on the storage Blocks but does not destroy the actual data.</p> </li> <li> <p>ATA/NVMe Sanitize Crypto Scramble (aka Instant Secure Erase, Crypto Erase), which applies to self-encrypting SSD drives: This method will change the encryption key of the self-encrypting SSD drive and render all the data stored in it unreadable.</p> </li> <li> <p>ATA/NVMe Sanitize Block Erase: This method performs an actual block erase on every storage block and will destroy the data and change the encryption key if present.</p> </li> <li> <p>ATA/NVMe Sanitize Overwrite (terribly slow, could be dangerous and not recommended): This method performs a block erase and then overwrite every storage block (it is the same as Block Erase but will overwrite data in addition). This method is overkill and not necessary.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Physical Destruction:</p> <ul> <li> <p>HDDs:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Open the drive (with a screwdriver, usually Torx T8)</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove platters (with a screwdriver, usually Torx T6)</p> </li> <li> <p>Rub the platters with a rare earth magnet</p> </li> <li> <p>Break/Deform/Crush the platters</p> </li> <li> <p>Burn the platters or cook them in an oven (do not skip this step)</p> </li> <li> <p>Separate the debris</p> </li> <li> <p>Throw away in separate places</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>SSDs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ideally you should wipe the drive through other means first, as this method alone is not known to be secure against all attackers</p> </li> <li> <p>Open the drive</p> </li> <li> <p>Break/Crush the board and memory cells</p> </li> <li> <p>Burn them</p> </li> <li> <p>Separate the debris</p> </li> <li> <p>Throw away in separate places</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Bonus: See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bpX8YvNg6Y <sup>[Invidious]</sup></p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For maximum overkill paranoia security, Sanitize Block Erase option should be preferred but Secure Erase is probably more than enough when considering your drive is already encrypted. Unfortunately, are no free easy (bootable with a graphical menu) all-in-one tools available and you will be left with either going with drive manufacturers provided tools, the free manual hdparm<sup>437</sup> , and nvme-cli<sup>438</sup> utilities or going with a commercial tool such as PartedMagic.</p> <p>This guide will therefore recommend the use of the free utilities hdparm and nvme-cli using a Live System Rescue system.</p> <p>If you can afford it, just buy Parted Magic for 11$ which provides an easy-to-use graphical tool for wiping SSD drives using the option of your choice<sup>439</sup>'<sup>440</sup>.</p> <p>Note: Again, before proceeding, you should check your BIOS as some will offer a built-in tool to securely erase your drive (ATA/NVMe Secure Erase or ATA/NVMe Sanitize).

This can be done with many utilities on all OSes.</p> <p>With an SSD drive, however, again everything becomes a bit complicated because you are never sure anything is really deleted due to wear leveling, reliance on the Trim operation, and garbage collection of the drive. An adversary that has the decryption key of your SSD (whether it is LUKS, Filevault 2, Veracrypt, or Bitlocker) could unlock your drive and then attempt a recovery using classic recovery utilities<sup>441</sup> and could succeed if the data were not trimmed properly. But this is again highly unlikely.</p> <p>Since the Trim operation is not continuous on most recent hard drives but scheduled, simply forcing a Trim operation should be enough. But again, the only way to be 100% sure a file is securely deleted from your unlocked encrypted SSD is to again overwrite all the free space after deletion of the files in question or to decrypt/re-encrypt the drive. But this is overkill and not necessary. A simple disk-wide Trim should be sufficient.</p> <p>Remember tho that no matter the deletion method you use for any file on any medium (HDD drive, SSD, USB Thumb drive).

Even simpler. Just carefully make a note within the document with a pencil. And then erase it with any pencil eraser as if you wanted to correct it. The trick is to carefully leave the eraser traces/residues on the area you erased/pencil written areas and close the document. You could also take a picture of the residues before closing the document.</p> <p>Most likely if someone went through your document to read it and re-placed it carefully, this residue will fall off or be moved significantly.

Well, OPSEC means Operations Security<sup>455</sup>. The basic definition is: \"OPSEC is the process of protecting individual pieces of data that could be grouped together to give the bigger picture.\"</p> <p>The important step here, and probably the easiest one, is a lesson you can take from the movie Fight Club: the first rule is that you do not talk about Fight Club. This applies to many aspects of your online operational security or OPSEC. Taking your time to go through this guide will reward you with the tools and knowledge to embrace a fuller, more secure experience on the internet. Rest assured that this guide will reveal things to you that will frustrate your enemy. You will learn how to protect your operating systems and lockdown your critical information and ensure mission success. But the one thing you must adhere to is this rule of thumb - do not talk about operation details. The biggest adversarial threat to you is OSINT (discussed below and throughout the document). The enemy will gather information on you based on what they observe about you and your activities online and in real life.</p> <p>Adversaries take many forms. To some, they are actors of a foreign government, while to others they may be simply a rival company's employee looking to find disgruntled workers to target for further pressuring. To most, the general task of OPSEC is that this is your ship - you must not do anything or say anything to sink your own ship. Simply expressing your frustration with your boss or your work conditions or your equipment, might be enough to generate not only a behavior profile but also a vector of attack. A disgruntled employee, in this example, is what generally provides enough information to warrant pressuring of that employee for further information and possibly even extortion, blackmail, or worse. Failure to implement basic OPSEC can lead to failure at various points. It can lead to serious injury or even death if your threat model is a determined attacker, foreign actor, and so on.</p> <p>You must live by the simple rule that \"loose lips sink ships\" - but also that they are usually your lips which will do the sinking.

It reduces a footprint\u2019s spread primarily by blocking trackers. Sometimes this can increase the size of a footprint.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tracking evasion (TE)</p> <ul> <li>TE reduces the amount of data exposed by a user. Rather than eliminating data collection itself, TE prevents useful data from being made available in the first place. In other words, it reduces a footprint\u2019s size.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Browsers that provide Tracking Reduction are to be used for a more casual [Threat Model][Appendix B3: Threat modeling resources] whereas Tracking Evasion is more complex. But both need to be explored. Tracking Reduction focuses on browsing with less tracking. It involves things like content-blocking, firewalls, opt-outs, flipping telemetry buttons, etc. If you're this far into the guide, you likely have a very good understanding of this already. Tracking Evasion, however, involves techniques like using the portable Tor Browser Bundle to anonymize your footprint and online identity, avoiding identifiable extensions, and using randomized keystroke delays. It's more about minimizing your online footprint, to give you a less fingerprintable browsing environment and internet usage.</p> <p>A brief mention of this is necessary in determining operation needs for both.

Or accessing Tor openly might be a safety risk.</p> <p>In those cases, it might be necessary to use Tor bridges to connect to the Tor network (see Tor Documentation https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/bridges <sup>[Archive.org]</sup> and Whonix Documentation https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Bridges <sup>[Archive.org]</sup>). Optionally, if you are able, you should (seriously!) consider running a bridge https://blog.torproject.org/run-tor-bridges-defend-open-internet/ <sup>[Archive.org]</sup> yourself, as this would greatly help reduce the amount of censorship in the world.</p> <p>Bridges are special Tor entry nodes that are not listed on the Tor public directory. Some of those are running on people running the Snowflake Browser extension<sup>515</sup> while others are running on various servers around the world. Most of those bridges are running some type of obfuscation method called obfs4<sup>516</sup>.</p> <p>Only available for Desktop Tor users: Recently, the Tor Project has made it incredibly simple to access Bridges with Connection Assist, and it is now automatically done in hostile or censored regions. Simply open the Tor Browser and the connection will be configured based on your needs on any hostile network. Previously, we had a list of options below this paragraph which were necessary to enable and configure bridges, but now that this is done automatically using moat. <sup>[Archive.org]</sup></p> <p>Here is the definition from the Tor Browser Manual<sup>517</sup>: \"obfs4 makes Tor traffic look random and prevents censors from finding bridges by Internet scanning. obfs4 bridges are less likely to be blocked than its predecessor, obfs3 bridges\".</p> <p>Some of those are called \"Meek\" bridges and are using a technique called \"Domain Fronting\" where your Tor client (Tails, Tor Browser, Whonix Gateway) will connect to a common CDN used by other services. To a censor, it would appear you are connecting to a normal website such as Microsoft.com. See https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/meek for more information.</p> <p>As per their definition from their manual: \"meek transports make it look like you are browsing a major web site instead of using Tor. meek-azure makes it look like you are using a Microsoft web site\". Snowflake bridges make it appear like your connections are phone calls to random internet users. This is a type of \"domain fronting\" <sup>518</sup>.

He also used emoji smiley faces in his writing, though he never used a hyphen as the nose, writing them as \":)\" rather than the old-fashioned \":-)\".

Do not use an AutoCorrect automatic replace option for this as it might correct when it does not make sense. Instead, use Search and Replace and do this manually for each word. Do not use \"Replace All\" either and review each change. This is just the first step, for providing misinformation against linguistic fingerprinting.</p> <p>Next, find a list of words that you commonly use in your writing. Let us say that we love to use contractions when wew rite, maybe we always use words such as: \"can't\", \"don't\", \"shouldn't\", \"won't\", or \"let's\". Well, maybe go into LibreWriter and use \"Search and Replace\" to replace all contractions with the full versions of the words (\"can't\" &gt; \"cannot\", \"don't\" &gt; \"do not\", \"shouldn't\" &gt; \"should not\", \"won't\" &gt; \"will not\", \"let's\" &gt; \"let us\").

Maybe you live in the US, and you want to give the impression that your identity is from the UK. For example, you can make use of location-based spelling and lexicon. This is risky, and one mistake can give it away.</p> <p>First off, you need to decide where you want to give the impression of your location. Here is an example to give off the impression that you are from the US, or the UK. First, you will need to understand a thing or two about where your identity is \"from\", do not pretend that you are from the UK, yet have no idea about it other than it exists.</p> <p>After you have decided upon a good location that your identity is from, research the differences in language between the two languages (in this case between UK English and US English). Thanks to the internet, this is quite easy, and you can find Wikipedia pages conveniently highlighting the regional differences of a language between two nations. Pay attention to how certain words are spelled (\"metre\" &gt; \"meter\") and what words are exchanged with each other (\"boot\" &gt; \"trunk\"). Now that you have a list of words that can be exchanged with each other, and a list of spelling that are different, use the \"Search and Replace\" in your editor and change the words such as \"colour\" into \"color\", and \"lorry\" into \"truck\". Again, do not use an AutoCorrect feature or \"Replace All\" as some changes might not make sense. Review each proposed change.

Orbot is acting as a device-wide VPN (also known as a \"transparent proxy\"). The list of apps using Orbot is a whitelist. This list will not make some apps magically use Tor and unchecked ones use the clear-net. This only ensures the device-wide VPN is using Tor to route traffic. This means that Orbot can only control what app can access the VPN it creates. Other apps will lose connectivity.</p> <p>What is important to know is that, if you launch an app (or Android does it automatically) while Orbot is not running, the app will just use the normal network, without involving Orbot (with the exception of some apps supporting a proxy Orbot).</p> <p>Additionally, you should not be surprised by Tor Browser not working when using Orbot in VPN mode, as the Tor design does not allow \"Tor over Tor\" (you cannot re-enter the Tor network from a Tor exit node).</p> <p>This is explained rather well by Alexander F\u00e6r\u00f8y, who is a core developer at the Tor Project, in their TorifyHOWTO: Tor over Tor.</p> <p>\"When using a transparent proxy, it is possible to start a Tor session from the client as well as from the transparent proxy (read the warning!), creating a \"Tor over Tor\" scenario. Doing so produces undefined and potentially unsafe behavior. In theory, however, you can get six hops instead of three, but it is not guaranteed that you'll get three different hops - you could end up with the same hops, maybe in reverse or mixed order. It is not clear if this is safe. It has never been discussed. You can choose an entry/exit point, but you get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor; overriding the entry / exit nodes can mess up your anonymity in ways we don't understand. Therefore Tor over Tor usage is highly discouraged.\"</p> <p>And from a post on the Tor Stack Exchange:</p> <p>\"The danger (beyond the performance hit) which keeps me from running Tor over Tor has to do with timing and congestion measurements. Adversaries watching your traffic at the exit(s) of your circuits have a better chance of linking your Whonix activity with your [Tor Browser Bundle] activity when those shared circuits slow down or drop packets at the same time. This can happen without Tor over Tor when your instances use a common upstream link. The linkage will be made tighter and more explicit if you run the Whonix Tor traffic through your TBB SOCKS5 Tor circuits. This tighter linkage raises the danger of successful correlation.\"</p>"},{"location":"guide/#appendix-b7-caution-about-session-messenger","title":"Appendix B7: Caution about Session Messenger","text":"<ul> <li>They use LokiNet, which requires Oxen to run nodes to route Session traffic, and it costs 15,000 $OXEN or 3,750 $OXEN for a shared node<sup>531</sup>, which is about ~$1,800 US dollars or ~$500 US dollars, respectively.
