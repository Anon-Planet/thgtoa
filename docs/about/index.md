**Anonymous Planet** are the maintainers of the Hitchhiker's Guide and the PSA Matrix space.

The purpose: providing an introduction to various online tracking techniques, online ID verification techniques, and detailed guidance to creating and maintaining (truly) anonymous online identities. It is written in the hopes that activists, journalists, scientists, lawyers, whistle-blowers, etc. - i.e., good people - will be able to fight oppression, censorship and harassment! The website and projects are free (as in freedom) and not affiliated with any donor or projects discussed.
