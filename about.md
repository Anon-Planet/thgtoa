Hello, I am Alex. My pronouns are they/them. After unfortunate recent events, I have picked up maintenance of this guide in order to continue the project AnonyPla started. Unfortunately, Lena passed during a complex surgery. We believe she went peacefully in her sleep and she did not suffer. Before her surgery, she gave me access to her accounts to maintain the guide. I will be maintaining her guide, as well as running her Matrix space, from this point. As I said before, I cannot guarantee I'll do everything right, or how she would have done it, but I'm trying my best.
