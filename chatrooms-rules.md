- No hate speech (no racism, no homophobia, no transphobia...)
- No spam
- No doxxing unless you have express permission and you move to ```#bnonymity```

Just because the bot is down temporarily doesn't mean shit.Some exceptions can apply, see the [exceptions](#exceptions) section at the bottom of this page. Violations will be handled at the discretion of the acting moderator.
