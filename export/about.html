<p>Hello, I am Alex. My pronouns are they/them. After unfortunate recent events, I have picked up maintenance of this guide in order to continue the project AnonyPla started. Unfortunately, Lena passed during a complex surgery. We believe she went peacefully in her sleep and she did not suffer. Before her surgery, she gave me access to her accounts to maintain the guide. I will be maintaining her guide, as well as running her Matrix space, from this point. As I said before, I cannot guarantee I’ll do everything right, or how she would have done it, but I’m trying my best.</p>

<p><strong>Below you’ll find the original about text from the initial founder, Lena, of this guide before she went missing, most links are invalid.</strong></p>
<p>This text will remain here in memoriam of her legacy and the incredible work she did vastly alone without any contributors.</p>

<p>Hello I’m back,</p>
<p><strong>First I’ll thank you immensely Alex for salvaging this and helping me. Thank you. Thank you so much.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Lena, I’m 22 years old, I’m Ukrainian from Kyiv. Online, I’m I’m just a simple anonymity and privacy activist. I also used to be an activist in real life for various causes and did my share of protests. I was forced to flee the country like many others, and for the moment reside in Germany.</p>
<p>I’m a firm supporter of human rights, equality, repect, I hate corruption, and now … sorry but not sorry … I seriously dislike Russians who still support Putin but in particular, I really hate pro-russian Chechnians who came to Ukraine for the sport as they are just savages to my eyes. This is my sole personal opinion.</p>
<p>I also strongly believe privacy should be a universal right and that anonymity should never become illegal. I don’t want our lives to turn into Gattaca, Minority Report, Black Mirror, or 1984 (Too late for that one, I’m afraid). I do not want our laws and rights to become terms of services.</p>
<p>My goal is to bring accessible knowledge on these topics to the many and hopefully reach the few good people who really need it. In this specific case, I think the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many.</p>
<p>Some facts about me: - I am not rich. - I enjoy good memes, movies, series, and books (and I’m sure some of you will spot some of the many references to those in my project).</p>
