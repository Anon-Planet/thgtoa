<h1 id="a-constitution-for-an-anonymous-planet.">A Constitution for an
Anonymous Planet.</h1>
<p>To amend the rules and regulations of the network and of the PSA
community, this constitution is hereby set forth. It is applicable to
all the projects of the initiative, especially the Hitchhiker’s Guide to
Online Anonymity. All members/collaborators must abide by these lines
when contributing within the context of the initiative.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Our content is licensed under <strong><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Creative Commons
Attribution NonCommercial</a></strong> to prevent commercial usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="anonymity-above-everything">1. Anonymity above everything</h3>
<p>Anonymity is necessary to maintain the balance of power, specifically
to help journalists, whistleblowers, lawyers, scientists, and victims of
oppression. Anonymity first, even if that means using non-free and/or
proprietary means. Security and privacy are second, again, even if using
non-free or non-open-source and/or proprietary means. In this sense, the
ends may at times justify proprietary means.</p>
<h3 id="independence">2. Independence</h3>
<p>The Anonymous Planet initiative has no affiliation with the
“Anonymous” collective and does not endorse their activities.<br />
Any overlap of their activities and our guide are purely
coincidental.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility">3. Accessibility</h3>
<p>We will strive to always keep available the following methods of
reading the Hitchhiker’s Guide:<br />
* online;<br />
* offline (e.g., PDF, ODT, EPUB (in the future));<br />
* via the Tor network</p>
<h3 id="freedom">4. Freedom</h3>
<p>Maintain free, open-source, and non-commercial nature of all our
projects. This does not mean proprietary and/or closed-source tools
won’t be recommendeded. All scientific knowledge should be free for
anyone and we support and encourage Sci-Hub and LibGen. Any attempt to
erode the freedom of information and flow of knowledge of our projects,
in any manner, is hostile.</p>
<h3 id="verifiability-falsifiability-and-reproducibility">5.
Verifiability, falsifiability and reproducibility</h3>
<p>We will make every effort to be transparent about any and all bias we
have.<br />
Anyone claiming to be unbiased is lying, therefore we will not falsely
claim to be.</p>
<p>All our content shall be verifiable, reproducible and
fact-checked:<br />
- academic references (e.g., studies, papers, and peer reviewed
publications);<br />
- reputable media references (e.g., articles, videos, and
documentaries);<br />
- official documentation (e.g., manuals, field guides, and technical
documents);<br />
- renowned and reputable expert review;<br />
- direct testing by our own collaborators for falsifiablity</p>
<h3 id="innocence">6. Innocence</h3>
<p>Suspected offenders are innocent until proven guilty, with zero
tolerance for abuse of power or position.</p>
<p>Any accusing/moderating member is: - Subject to the burden of proving
the wrong-doing of the offender. - Required to motivate any
sanction.</p>
<p>Any offender has the right to: - Face their accuser (know who is
accusing them). - Appeal sanctions to an uninvolved third party. -
Participate in their own incrimination (the burden of proof lies with
the accuser). - Due process of the above.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-of-thought">7. Freedom of thought</h3>
<p>Open-minded and pragmatic - with no tolerance for gatekeeping.</p>
<p>Critical thinking and fact-checking are strongly encouraged; we
welcome criticism including of a harsh nature (excluding ad-hominem and
slurs).</p>
<h3 id="we-do-not-tolerate-intolerance">8. We do not tolerate
intolerance</h3>
<p>See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance">Paradox of
Tolerance</a>, which includes hate speech.</p>
<h3 id="no-analytics">9. No analytics</h3>
<p>Note that, while we will never use analytics, the (now free)
platforms hosting our content might be gathering such analytics outside
of our control, such as Github pages. As the initiative progresses, we
will strive to avoid these as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="no-profit">10. No profit</h3>
<p>Any excess donations will only be used to support our main projects
first and possibly support other intitiatives (like hosting Tor exit
nodes). In all cases, we abide by the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding transparency (i.e., all donations, spendings, source code,
and future goals will be public).<br />
</li>
<li>Acceptance of donations from any entity anonymously or acknowledged
(opt-in) will not have any influence on our content.<br />
</li>
<li>No sponsored content.<br />
</li>
<li>No affiliate links.<br />
</li>
<li>No product placements.<br />
</li>
<li>No advertising.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: it is possible that, coincidentally, a donation
could correlate with a recommendation. It will then be clearly stated
that while the donation was welcome, the donating entity will not be
gaining visibility/coverage/endorsement/recommendations due to such a
donation.</strong></p>
<h2 id="core-goals.">Core Goals.</h2>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>Help people in need of anonymity to maintain both their physical and
digital safety.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="non-goals">Non-Goals:</h2>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>Help any people who are using this knowledge for bad purposes.
Helping people takes precedence and we know our content can be used
nefariously. Our initiative believes in having one good person given an
anonymous voice, safely, is worth the risk of having several using our
content for evil. As we do adhere to a fair “rule of law” system which,
having 9 criminals and 1 innocent person free, is much better than
having one innocent person in prison among 9 criminals.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Yours faithfully, Anonymous Planet</strong></p>
