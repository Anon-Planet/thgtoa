The current maintainers of this project are Alex (they/them) and The Hidden (aka No).

After unfortunate events, we have picked up maintenance of this guide in order to continue the project the original founder, Lena, started. Lena faked her death, then returned later. Before her <del>death</del>, she gave me access to her accounts to maintain the guide. I will be maintaining her guide, as well as running her Matrix space, from this point. As we've said before, we cannot guarantee we'll do everything right, or how she would have done it, but we're trying our best.
